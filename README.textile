h2. Usage

To create nice search summaries, use the following syntax:

<pre>{exp:search_summary hash="{segment_2}"}{content_body}{/exp:search_summary}</pre>
	
Where {segment_2} is the search hash in the URL.

By default, the plugin uses HTML5 <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> elements to wrap the keywords found. You can override that by setting the html version:

<pre>{exp:search_summary hash="{segment_2}" html_version="4"}{content_body}{/exp:search_summary}</pre>
	
By default, each found keyword is also classified as a “term,” but you can define your own class as well:

<pre>{exp:search_summary hash="{segment_2}" highlight_class="found"}{content_body}{/exp:search_summary}</pre>

You can also define (in order of priority) up to 10 alternate fields you’d like to summarize if a match isn’t found in the primary tag:

<pre>{exp:search_summary hash="{segment_2}" alternate_1="{content_sidebar}" alternate_2="{content_footer}"}{content_body}{/exp:search_summary}</pre>
